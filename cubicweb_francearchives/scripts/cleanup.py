"""Script to clean authority labels (related to #67658751).

Usage: cubicweb-ctl fa_ed cleanup.py [FILE]...[FILE]

Calling this script without any arguments leads to it generating
an output file for each authority type containing the cleaned
labels. Calling this script with one or more input files leads
to it updating the database with any labels it finds in the
CSV files.

The CSV file is comma-separated and contains the fields
'identifiant', 'URI_autorite', 'libelle_ancien', 'libelle_nouveau',
'autorite', of which 'identifiant', 'libelle_nouveau' and 'autorite'
are used when updating the database."""
