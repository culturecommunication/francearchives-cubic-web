Recompute FindingAid and FAComponent stable ids by services only
for OIA harvested services

ElasticSearch reindexing is needed after the script is done

1/ delete FAComponent and FindinAid entries for services, f.e :

  curl -H content-type:application/json -XPOST
  'host/index/_doc/_delete_by_query?pretty' -d
  '{"query": {"bool": {"must": [{"term": {"publisher": "AD du Cher"}},
  {"term": {"cw_etype": "FindingAid"}}]}}}'


  curl -H content-type:application/json -XPOST
  'host/index/_doc/_delete_by_query?pretty' -d
  '{"query": {"bool": {"must": [{"term": {"publisher": "AD du Cher"}},
  {"term": {"cw_etype": "FAComponent"}}]}}}

 2/ run scripts/index-in-es-by-service.py to reindex services
    python index-in-es-by-service.py "AD du Cher" instance --es-index=index
